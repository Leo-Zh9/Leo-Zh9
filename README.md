# Leo Zhang

Check me out @ [leo-zhang.com](https://leo-zhang.com)!

I'm a Systems Design Engineering student at the University of Waterloo, driven by curiosity for how intelligent systems connect people, data, and design. My work blends software development, AI, and systems thinking to create tools that are both technically robust and thoughtfully designed.

Iâ€™m especially interested in projects that challenge assumptions, integrate multiple disciplines, and turn abstract ideas into practical solutions.
